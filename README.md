[00:08.24] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[00:11.88] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[00:14.60] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[00:18.28] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[00:21.38] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[00:24.65] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[00:27.84] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[00:35.34] 
[00:33.89] Legend aren't born that way
[00:39.04] But by deeds
[00:40.51] Bloodlines denotes nothing
[00:46.49] How do towering trees grow from the seed
[00:49.55] And achievements rise from the ash?
[00:52.92] We endure and suffer loss and bleed
[00:56.02] Still, we clashed against the sky
[01:12.52] 
[00:59.84] You and I are weak like the reeds
[01:06.18] But chasing flames is carved into creed, oh-oh
[01:13.44] Cleave the darkness and seize the light
[01:19.48] Daybreak meant to be free
[01:22.74] We are gonna shatter the ties
[01:37.24] 
[01:29.14] Time's worn away the lives and bygones
[01:35.89] Leaving faith to resound
[01:41.49] Behold all the pioneering souls
[01:44.75] In the gloom, they strive to flash
[01:48.14] Through the journey's filled with wounds and tolls
[01:51.11] Still, we clash against the sky
[02:06.61] 
[01:55.13] Let's defy the judgment of flaws
[02:01.36] Would rather die than kneel down or crawl, oh-oh
[02:08.35] Cleave the darkness, seize the light
[02:14.55] Daybreak's meant to be free
[02:17.61] We are gonna shatter the ties
[02:32.11] 
[02:33.96] (You and I, are still gonna touch the sky)
[02:37.20] (You and I, we are gonna pay the price)
[02:40.59] (You and I, sleep like a butterfly)
[02:43.66] (You and I, we are gonna pay the price)
[02:46.98] (You and I, are still gonna touch the sky)
[02:50.17] (You and I, we are gonna pay the price)
[02:53.42] (You and I, sleep like a butterfly)
[02:56.72] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[03:04.22] 
[02:59.97] You and I are weak like the reeds
[03:06.46] But chasing flames is carved into creed, oh-oh
[03:13.44] Cleave the darkness, seize the light
[03:19.36] A brand-new dawn's within reach
[03:22.61] We are gonna make it untied
[03:36.11] 
[03:39.36] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[03:42.58] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[03:45.76] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
[03:48.85] (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
